# Grub
These file systems are installed on the target storage device (e.g., hard drive or SSD) during the Arch Linux installation process. After installing the file systems, you configure them in the /mnt/etc/fstab file, as mentioned earlier. When the Arch Linux system boots, the boot loader (like GRUB or systemd-boot) loads the kernel, and the kernel then mounts the configured file systems according to the /etc/fstab instructions before starting the rest of the boot process.
